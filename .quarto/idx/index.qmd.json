When referring to two or more sources by the same author in different years, you don’t need to repeat the author's surname in the citation. Include the surname and the oldest year first, then separate the rest with by semicolons (;) in chronological order starting with the oldest first\n\nInput:\n\n- ```@kra2022infinite did blah and then worked on blah [-@kra2022proof; -@kra2023problems].```\n\nOutput:\n\n- @kra2022infinite did blah and then worked on blah [-@kra2022proof; -@kra2023problems].\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Kra et al. (2022a) did blah and then worked on blah (2022b; 2023).\n\nNote:\n\n- Sadly, CSL can only do commas between years for the same author. Fortunately, this is only a minor shortcoming.\n\n### Direct Citations\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- If the author’s name forms a natural part of your sentence, then you just need to note the relevant year (within parentheses) after the author(s) name.\n\n#### Standard Example\n\nInput:\n\n- ```@bergelson_1996 says blah.```\n\nOutput:\n\n- @bergelson_1996 says blah.\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Bergelson (1996) says blah.\n\n#### Standard Example with Locator\n\nInput:\n\n- ```@bergelson_1996 [p. 2] says blah.```\n\nOutput:\n\n- @bergelson_1996 [p. 2] says blah.\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Bergelson (1996, p. 2) says blah.\n\n#### Date Only\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Bergelson says blah [-@bergelson_1996].```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Bergelson says blah [-@bergelson_1996].\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Bergelson says blah (1996).\n\n### Indirect Citations\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- If you do not mention the author’s name within your text, then place both the name and year in parentheses, at the end of the sentence.\n\n#### Standard Example\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Bergelson, 1996).

Blah Blah [@kra2023problems, Section 1]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996, p. 2]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems, Section 1]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Bergelson, 1996, p. 2). Blah Blah (Kra et al., 2023, Section 1)\n\n#### Authors supporting the same argument\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- Cite both names and separate with a semi-colon. List citations in chronological order (earliest date first) of year before surname, if the the citations are in the same year, then order in date then alphabetical order.\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996; @kra2023problems]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996; @kra2023problems]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Bergelson, 1996; Kra et al., 2023)\n\n#### Authors supporting the same argument with Prefixes, Locators and Suffixes\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [see @bergelson_1996, p. 2; and @kra2023problems, Theorem 2.2]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [see @bergelson_1996, p. 2; and @kra2023problems, Theorem 2.2]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (see Bergelson, 1996, p. 2; and Kra et al., 2023, Theorem 2.2)\n\n#### Authors with the same surname\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- If two or more authors have the same surname then you need to provide more information to identify the source from which a quotation is taken. You should provide both author’s first initials (or even the authors' full name if different authors share initials) in your citation.\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [@prince2024; @prince2022; @prince2026]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [@prince2024; @prince2022; @prince2026]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Kai Prince, 2022; Kira Prince, 2026; L. Prince, 2024)\n\n#### Citing sources from another source\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- When you wish to refer to a source that is cited or quoted in another authors work then you need to acknowledge this. This is known as indirect or secondary referencing. Use the term 'cited in' or 'quoted in' within your work. \n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [Moreira, Richter and Robertson, 2019, cited in @kra2023problems]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [Moreira, Richter and Robertson, 2019, cited in @kra2023problems]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Moreira, Richter and Robertson, 2019, cited in Kra et al., 2023)\n\n### Other In-Text Citation Rules \n\n#### Short Quotations\n\nAny quotations used should be relevant to the argument you are making. Short quotations (4 or fewer lines of prose or 3 of verse) can be set in quotation marks and included within the body of the text.\n\nEnclose the quotation within single quotation marks, and then provide the author and specific page citation (in the case of verse, provide line numbers) in the text, and include a complete reference in the reference list. Punctuation marks such as commas, and semi-colons should appear after the parenthetical citation. Question marks and exclamation should appear within the quotation marks if they are a part of the quoted passage, but after the parenthetical citation if they are a part of your text.\n\n#### Long Quotations\n\nLonger quotations need to be entered as a separate paragraph and indented from the main text. You do not need to use quotation marks.\n\n#### Alterations, omissions, emphasis\n\n- To omit part of a quotation use an ellipsis (...).\n\n- You can insert your own words into the quotation by putting them in square brackets.\n\n- If the original quotation contains errors (e.g. a spelling mistake) do not correct it. Instead point out the errors by writing [sic],\n  - The Latin adverb sic ('thus', 'just as'; in full: sic erat scriptum, 'thus was it written')\n\n- Be consistent, you can use double or single quotations marks within your work, we suggest...\n  - Use single quotation marks ('...') to indicate direct quotations and the definition of words.\n  - Double quotation marks (\"...\") are used for a quote within a quote.\n\n#### Page numbers and other locators\n\nPage numbers are only required in the reference list for chapters in books, and periodical (journal/magazine/newspaper) articles.\n\nThe abbreviation p. is used for single pages and pp. for more than one.\n\nNote that page numbers are not elided (for example, don't use pp. 90–9) \n\nIf the page numbers are in Roman numerals, do not include p. before them.\n\n#### Translations\n\n- Narrative citation uses original author; translator acknowledged in reference list (Translated by Surname, Initial.). In-text remains (Original Author, Year).\n\n#### Non-Roman scripts\n\n- Provide transliterated author and title; optionally include original script in brackets in the reference list. In-text cite transliteration consistently.\n\n#### Self-citation (student's own unpublished work)\n\nRequired elements:\n\n- Student surname.\n\n- Year of submission in parentheses followed by full stop.\n\n- Title of the essay/assignment, in single quotation marks\n\n- Module code:module title , in italics.\n\n- Institution.\n\n- \"Unpublished essay/assignment.\"\n\n#### Personal communications / anonymised interviews\n\nAnonymised sources are listed as Participant/Client/Patient A, B, C etc. and, in the referencing list, presented in [square brackets].\n\n## Reference List\n\n### Manchester Harvard Guidance\n\n#### Authors, Editors and Translators\n\nAuthor details: surname followed by a comma followed by initial(s) followed by a full stop.\n\n- If two or more authors have the same surname then you need to provide more information to identify the source from which a quotation is taken. You should provide both author’s first initials (or even the authors' full name if different authors share initials) in your citation.\n\n- For social media sources, include the author's full name (or names) if available or use the username or screen name.\n\n- No author: If you cannot identify the author of a document use the title of the work italicised.\n\n- Two authors: authors separated by the word 'and’.\n\n- Three authors: first author to penultimate author separated by commas. Penultimate author and last author separated by the word and. \n\n- Four or more authors: first author followed by ‘et al’.\n\nEditor(s) no author(s): same procedure as with an author but include (ed.) or (eds.) after the names.\n\n- Author of a chapter within an edited text: provide the full bibliographic details in your works cited list.\n\n- Author(s) and editor(s): use the procedure as if it were an authored work and include the term \"Edited by\" followed by the editor(s) names spelled out in \"Initial. Surname\" format. \n\n\nTranslators: \"Translated by\" before names (\"surname, initial.\" format).\n\n#### Year\n\n- Year in parentheses followed by a period; add lowercase letter suffixes for same-author same-year sets.\n\n- Use \"no date\" for undated sources.\n\n#### Title\n\nTitle casing: sentence case (first word and proper nouns) for article, chapter, report titles; italicise standalone works (books, reports, theses, standards, acts, webpages, podcasts, software, datasets where appropriate). Chapter / article titles in single quotation marks.\n\nSub-titles: If a sub-title is provided, a colon follows the title. Only proper nouns should be capitalized. The sub-title is followed by a full stop.\n\n#### Issue information\n\nVolume/Part (when available) for journal articles.\n\n#### Edition\n\nOrdinal + 'edn.' when not first edition. Place after title (before publisher) for books.\n\n#### Publication Location and Publisher\n\nPublication location: For books, include the town or city and state (if applicable) where the book was published. Include country if there is a possible confusion with the UK. For academic journals, this is not necessary. This is followed by a full stop.\n\nPublisher: For books, include the name of the publisher. For academic journals, include the journal's name. Followed by a full stop.\n\n#### Page ranges\n\nIf there is a page range, the preceding full-stop becomes a comma.\n\nUse en dash; prefix 'pp.' except single page 'p.'.\n\nPage numbers are only required in the reference list for chapters in books, and periodical (journal/magazine/newspaper) articles.\n\nFollowed by a full stop.\n\n#### Digital Object Identifier (DOI) or Uniform Resource Locator (URL)\n\nDOI preferred over URL: do not add 'Available at:' before DOI and follow with a full stop.\n\nWhen only a URL is provided: Access dates are required when a URL is used. and the format should be 'Available at: URL (Accessed: Access Date).'\n\n#### Format\n\nIf a format is required or for electronic sources that may not fit into standard categories (e.g., podcasts, videos, online presentations), format terms in square brackets (e.g [Podcast] [Record] [Illustration] [Microfiche] [Computer Programme] [Systematic Review] [MP3] [video file] [PowerPoint presentation]).\n\n#### Database or Repository\n\nIf the source is accessed through a specific database or digital repository, you may include this information.\n\n#### Source Types\n\nThe University of Manchester Harvard (Manchester) official source type categories (A–Z) extracted August 2025:\n\n- Acts of Parliament\n  - EndNote reference type: Statute\n  - Active EndNote fields: Country, Name of Act, Year, International Source, Sections, Source, URL or DOI, Access Date\n- Blog\n  - EndNote reference type: Blog\n  - Active EndNote fields: Author, Year, Title of Entry, Title of WebLog, Last Update Date, URL or DOI, Access Date\n- Books\n  - EndNote reference type: Book\n  - Active EndNote fields: Author, Year, Title, Series Title, Translated by, Translator, Edition, Number of Volumes, Place Published, Publisher, Pages, Reprint, Reprint Edition\n- Books (translations)\n  - EndNote reference type: Book\n  - Active EndNote fields: Author, Year, Title, Series Title, Translated by, Translator, Edition, Number of Volumes, Place Published, Publisher, Pages, Reprint, Reprint Edition\n- British Standard\n  - EndNote reference type: Standard\n  - Active EndNote fields: Institution, Year, Rule Number, Title, Place Published, Publisher, Database Provider, Type of Work, URL or DOI, Access Date\n- Chapter in an edited book\n  - EndNote reference type: Book section\n  - Active EndNote fields: Author, Year, Title, Editor, Book Title, Series Volume, Series Title, Edition, Place Published, Publisher, Pages\n- Company, financial and medical databases\n  - EndNote reference type: Aggregated Database\n  - Active EndNote fields: Author, Year, Name of Database, Database Provider, URL, Date Accessed\n- Company annual reports\n  - EndNote reference type: Report\n  - Active EndNote fields: Author, Year, Title, Type, Document Number, Place Published, Institution, Database Provider, Pages, URL or DOI, Access Date\n- Conference proceedings\n  - EndNote reference type: Conference Proceedings\n  - Active EndNote fields: Author, Year of Conference, Title, Editor, Conference Name, Conference Location, Date Year of Conference, Place Published, Publisher, Pages, URL or DOI, Access Date\n- Discography (music)\n  - EndNote reference type: Music\n  - Active EndNote fields: Composer, Year, Title, Album Title, Format of Music, Place Published, Publisher, URL or DOI, Access Date\n- E-books\n  - EndNote reference type: Electronic Book\n  - Active EndNote fields: Author, Year, Title, Secondary Title, Edition, Place Published, Publisher, Database Provider, URL or DOI, Access Date\n- Edited Book\n  - EndNote reference type: Edited Book\n  - Active EndNote fields: Editor, Year, Title, Edition, Place Published, Publisher\n- Film, TV show or broadcast\n  - EndNote reference type: Film or Broadcast\n  - Active EndNote fields: Title, Year Released, Director, Format, Country, Distributor\n- Grant/Funding Proposal\n  - EndNote reference type: Grant\n  - Active EndNote fields: Investigators, Year, Title of Grant, Sponsoring Agency.

When referring to two or more sources by the same author in different years, you don’t need to repeat the author's surname in the citation. Include the surname and the oldest year first, then separate the rest with by semicolons (;) in chronological order starting with the oldest first\n\nInput:\n\n- ```@kra2022infinite did blah and then worked on blah [-@kra2022proof; -@kra2023problems].```\n\nOutput:\n\n- @kra2022infinite did blah and then worked on blah [-@kra2022proof; -@kra2023problems].\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Kra et al.

Fortunately, this is only a minor shortcoming.\n\n### Direct Citations\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- If the author’s name forms a natural part of your sentence, then you just need to note the relevant year (within parentheses) after the author(s) name.\n\n#### Standard Example\n\nInput:\n\n- ```@bergelson_1996 says blah.```\n\nOutput:\n\n- @bergelson_1996 says blah.\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Bergelson (1996) says blah.\n\n#### Standard Example with Locator\n\nInput:\n\n- ```@bergelson_1996 [p. 2] says blah.```\n\nOutput:\n\n- @bergelson_1996 [p. 2] says blah.\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Bergelson (1996, p. 2) says blah.\n\n#### Date Only\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Bergelson says blah [-@bergelson_1996].```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Bergelson says blah [-@bergelson_1996].\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Bergelson says blah (1996).\n\n### Indirect Citations\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- If you do not mention the author’s name within your text, then place both the name and year in parentheses, at the end of the sentence.\n\n#### Standard Example\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Bergelson, 1996). Blah Blah (Kra et al., 2023)\n\n#### Standard Example with Locator\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996, p. 2]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems, Section 1]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996, p. 2]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems, Section 1]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Bergelson, 1996, p. 2). Blah Blah (Kra et al., 2023, Section 1)\n\n#### Authors supporting the same argument\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- Cite both names and separate with a semi-colon. List citations in chronological order (earliest date first) of year before surname, if the the citations are in the same year, then order in date then alphabetical order.\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996; @kra2023problems]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996; @kra2023problems]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Bergelson, 1996; Kra et al., 2023)\n\n#### Authors supporting the same argument with Prefixes, Locators and Suffixes\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [see @bergelson_1996, p. 2; and @kra2023problems, Theorem 2.2]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [see @bergelson_1996, p. 2; and @kra2023problems, Theorem 2.2]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (see Bergelson, 1996, p. 2; and Kra et al., 2023, Theorem 2.2)\n\n#### Authors with the same surname\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- If two or more authors have the same surname then you need to provide more information to identify the source from which a quotation is taken. You should provide both author’s first initials (or even the authors' full name if different authors share initials) in your citation.\n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [@prince2024; @prince2022; @prince2026]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [@prince2024; @prince2022; @prince2026]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Kai Prince, 2022; Kira Prince, 2026; L. Prince, 2024)\n\n#### Citing sources from another source\n\nManchester Harvard Guidance:\n\n- When you wish to refer to a source that is cited or quoted in another authors work then you need to acknowledge this. This is known as indirect or secondary referencing. Use the term 'cited in' or 'quoted in' within your work. \n\nInput:\n\n- ```Blah Blah [Moreira, Richter and Robertson, 2019, cited in @kra2023problems]```\n\nOutput:\n\n- Blah Blah [Moreira, Richter and Robertson, 2019, cited in @kra2023problems]\n\nIdeal:\n\n- Blah Blah (Moreira, Richter and Robertson, 2019, cited in Kra et al., 2023)\n\n### Other In-Text Citation Rules \n\n#### Short Quotations\n\nAny quotations used should be relevant to the argument you are making. Short quotations (4 or fewer lines of prose or 3 of verse) can be set in quotation marks and included within the body of the text.\n\nEnclose the quotation within single quotation marks, and then provide the author and specific page citation (in the case of verse, provide line numbers) in the text, and include a complete reference in the reference list. Punctuation marks such as commas, and semi-colons should appear after the parenthetical citation. Question marks and exclamation should appear within the quotation marks if they are a part of the quoted passage, but after the parenthetical citation if they are a part of your text.\n\n#### Long Quotations\n\nLonger quotations need to be entered as a separate paragraph and indented from the main text. You do not need to use quotation marks.\n\n#### Alterations, omissions, emphasis\n\n- To omit part of a quotation use an ellipsis (...).\n\n- You can insert your own words into the quotation by putting them in square brackets.\n\n- If the original quotation contains errors (e.g. a spelling mistake) do not correct it. Instead point out the errors by writing [sic],\n  - The Latin adverb sic ('thus', 'just as'; in full: sic erat scriptum, 'thus was it written')\n\n- Be consistent, you can use double or single quotations marks within your work, we suggest...\n  - Use single quotation marks ('...') to indicate direct quotations and the definition of words.\n  - Double quotation marks (\"...\") are used for a quote within a quote.\n\n#### Page numbers and other locators\n\nPage numbers are only required in the reference list for chapters in books, and periodical (journal/magazine/newspaper) articles.\n\nThe abbreviation p. is used for single pages and pp. for more than one.\n\nNote that page numbers are not elided (for example, don't use pp. 90–9) \n\nIf the page numbers are in Roman numerals, do not include p. before them.\n\n#### Translations\n\n- Narrative citation uses original author; translator acknowledged in reference list (Translated by Surname, Initial.). In-text remains (Original Author, Year).\n\n#### Non-Roman scripts\n\n- Provide transliterated author and title; optionally include original script in brackets in the reference list.
