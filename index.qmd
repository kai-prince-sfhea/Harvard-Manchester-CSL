#### Multiple Works by the same Author

Manchester Harvard Guidance:

- If there are several works by one author (published in the same year) included in your Reference list entry, they should be differentiated by adding a lower case letter after the date. When referring to two or more sources by the same author in different years, you don’t need to repeat the author's surname in the citation. Include the surname and the oldest year first, then separate the rest with by semicolons (;) in chronological order starting with the oldest first

Input:

- ```@kra2022infinite did blah and then worked on blah [-@kra2022proof; -@kra2023problems].```

Output:

- @kra2022infinite did blah and then worked on blah [-@kra2022proof; -@kra2023problems].

Ideal:

- Kra et al. (2022a) did blah and then worked on blah (2022b; 2023).

Note:

- Sadly, CSL can only do commas between years for the same author. Fortunately, this is only a minor shortcoming.

### Direct Citations

Manchester Harvard Guidance:

- If the author’s name forms a natural part of your sentence, then you just need to note the relevant year (within parentheses) after the author(s) name.

#### Standard Example

Input:

- ```@bergelson_1996 says blah.```

Output:

- @bergelson_1996 says blah.

Ideal:

- Bergelson (1996) says blah.

#### Standard Example with Locator

Input:

- ```@bergelson_1996 [p. 2] says blah.```

Output:

- @bergelson_1996 [p. 2] says blah.

Ideal:

- Bergelson (1996, p. 2) says blah.

#### Date Only

Input:

- ```Bergelson says blah [-@bergelson_1996].```

Output:

- Bergelson says blah [-@bergelson_1996].

Ideal:

- Bergelson says blah (1996).

### Indirect Citations

Manchester Harvard Guidance:

- If you do not mention the author’s name within your text, then place both the name and year in parentheses, at the end of the sentence.

#### Standard Example

Input:

- ```Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems]```

Output:

- Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems]

Ideal:

- Blah Blah (Bergelson, 1996). Blah Blah (Kra et al., 2023)

#### Standard Example with Locator

Output:

- Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996, p. 2]. Blah Blah [@kra2023problems, Section 1]

Ideal:

- Blah Blah (Bergelson, 1996, p. 2). Blah Blah (Kra et al., 2023, Section 1)

#### Authors supporting the same argument

Manchester Harvard Guidance:

- Cite both names and separate with a semi-colon. List citations in chronological order (earliest date first) of year before surname, if the the citations are in the same year, then order in date then alphabetical order.

Input:

- ```Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996; @kra2023problems]```

Output:

- Blah Blah [@bergelson_1996; @kra2023problems]

Ideal:

- Blah Blah (Bergelson, 1996; Kra et al., 2023)

#### Authors supporting the same argument with Prefixes, Locators and Suffixes

Input:

- ```Blah Blah [see @bergelson_1996, p. 2; and @kra2023problems, Theorem 2.2]```

Output:

Ideal:

- Blah Blah (see Bergelson, 1996, p. 2; and Kra et al., 2023, Theorem 2.2)

#### Authors with the same surname

Manchester Harvard Guidance:

- If two or more authors have the same surname then you need to provide more information to identify the source from which a quotation is taken. You should provide both author’s first initials (or even the authors' full name if different authors share initials) in your citation.

Input:

- ```Blah Blah [@prince2024; @prince2022; @prince2026]```

Output:

- Blah Blah [@prince2024; @prince2022; @prince2026]

#### Citing sources from another source

Input:

- ```Blah Blah [Moreira, Richter and Robertson, 2019, cited in @kra2023problems]```

Output:

- Blah Blah [Moreira, Richter and Robertson, 2019, cited in @kra2023problems]

Ideal:

- Blah Blah (Moreira, Richter and Robertson, 2019, cited in Kra et al., 2023)

### Other In-Text Citation Rules 

#### Short Quotations

Any quotations used should be relevant to the argument you are making. Short quotations (4 or fewer lines of prose or 3 of verse) can be set in quotation marks and included within the body of the text.

Enclose the quotation within single quotation marks, and then provide the author and specific page citation (in the case of verse, provide line numbers) in the text, and include a complete reference in the reference list. Punctuation marks such as commas, and semi-colons should appear after the parenthetical citation. Question marks and exclamation should appear within the quotation marks if they are a part of the quoted passage, but after the parenthetical citation if they are a part of your text.

#### Long Quotations

Longer quotations need to be entered as a separate paragraph and indented from the main text. You do not need to use quotation marks.

#### Alterations, omissions, emphasis

- To omit part of a quotation use an ellipsis (...).

- You can insert your own words into the quotation by putting them in square brackets.

- If the original quotation contains errors (e.g. a spelling mistake) do not correct it. Instead point out the errors by writing [sic],
  - The Latin adverb sic ('thus', 'just as'; in full: sic erat scriptum, 'thus was it written')

- Be consistent, you can use double or single quotations marks within your work, we suggest...
  - Use single quotation marks ('...') to indicate direct quotations and the definition of words.
  - Double quotation marks ("...") are used for a quote within a quote.

#### Page numbers and other locators

Page numbers are only required in the reference list for chapters in books, and periodical (journal/magazine/newspaper) articles.

The abbreviation p. is used for single pages and pp. for more than one.

Note that page numbers are not elided (for example, don't use pp. 90–9) 

If the page numbers are in Roman numerals, do not include p. before them.

#### Translations

- Narrative citation uses original author; translator acknowledged in reference list (Translated by Surname, Initial.). In-text remains (Original Author, Year).

#### Non-Roman scripts

- Provide transliterated author and title; optionally include original script in brackets in the reference list. In-text cite transliteration consistently.

#### Self-citation (student's own unpublished work)

Required elements:

- Student surname.

- Year of submission in parentheses followed by full stop.

- Title of the essay/assignment, in single quotation marks

- Module code:module title , in italics.

- Institution.

- "Unpublished essay/assignment."

#### Personal communications / anonymised interviews

Anonymised sources are listed as Participant/Client/Patient A, B, C etc. and, in the referencing list, presented in [square brackets].
